# Keyboard Shortcuts

Canonical shortcut reference for Kami.

## Global

These shortcuts are handled by the global `useKeyboardShortcuts` hook and work regardless of editor focus.

| Shortcut        | Action                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Cmd+P           | File search (command palette) |
| Cmd+O           | Go to file                    |
| Cmd+N           | Create new note               |
| Cmd+T           | New tab                       |
| Cmd+W           | Close current tab             |
| Cmd+\\          | Toggle sidebar                |
| Ctrl+Tab        | Next tab                      |
| Ctrl+Shift+Tab  | Previous tab                  |
| Cmd+1 ... Cmd+9 | Jump to Nth tab               |
| Alt+ArrowLeft   | Navigate back                 |
| Alt+ArrowRight  | Navigate forward              |

In compact single-file windows, sidebar and tab-management shortcuts do not
create hidden UI state: Cmd+\\, Cmd+T, Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+Shift+Tab, and Cmd+1 ...
Cmd+9 are ignored. Cmd+P, Cmd+O, Cmd+N, and history navigation still work.

The tab shortcuts are unchanged by the columns layout — a tab and a pane are the
same record. Ctrl+Tab and Cmd+1 ... Cmd+9 move the focused pane and scroll it
into view. Alt+ArrowLeft / Alt+ArrowRight still walk the focused pane's own
history; in columns mode a followed link opens a new pane instead of navigating
in place, so those stacks are usually empty and the arrows sit disabled. See
[pane-layout.md](./pane-layout.md).

## Menu Accelerators

These shortcuts are bound to the native app menu (Tauri menu accelerators) rather than the global JS handler.

| Shortcut | Action                                                |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Cmd+,    | Open Preferences (Settings tab) in the focused window |

## Editor Formatting

These shortcuts are handled by the `markdownFormatting` CodeMirror extension and only apply when the editor is focused.

| Shortcut                | Action                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Cmd+B                   | Bold                      |
| Cmd+I                   | Italic                    |
| Cmd+K                   | Insert link               |
| Cmd+E                   | Inline code               |
| Cmd+Shift+X             | Strikethrough             |
| Cmd+Shift+8             | Bullet list               |
| Cmd+Shift+7             | Numbered list             |
| Cmd+Shift+.             | Blockquote                |
| Cmd+Shift+Enter         | Task list                 |
| Cmd+Alt+1 ... Cmd+Alt+6 | Heading 1-6               |
| Cmd+Alt+0               | Paragraph (strip heading) |
