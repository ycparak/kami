# Releasing Kami

How to cut a signed, notarized macOS release and publish it so the in-app updater picks it up. This is the process for an agent (or human) running locally on the maintainer's machine — releases are not built in CI.

## Signed vs. unsigned releases

`distribute.sh` supports two modes, chosen automatically from what's in `.env`:

- **Signed + notarized** (all four `APPLE_*` vars set): the app is signed with a Developer ID
  Application identity, submitted to Apple notarization, and stapled. Requires an active Apple
  Developer Program membership. Users get no Gatekeeper warning.
- **Unsigned** (no `APPLE_*` vars set): the build skips Developer ID signing and notarization
  entirely — no Apple Developer account needed. macOS Gatekeeper will flag the app as being from
  an unidentified developer; users must right-click → Open the first time, or run
  `xattr -cr /Applications/Kami.app`.

Setting only some of the four `APPLE_*` vars is an error — the script refuses to guess.

Either mode still signs the updater artifacts (`.app.tar.gz` / `.sig`) with the Tauri updater
keypair (`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`) — that's unrelated to Apple and always required, since
`createUpdaterArtifacts: true` in `tauri.conf.json` needs it to produce a valid `latest.json` for
the in-app updater.

## First Release Prerequisites

Nothing has shipped under this identity yet. Before the first run of `scripts/distribute.sh`:

- The GitHub repo `ycparak/kami` must exist, and this working tree must have it configured as `origin` (`git remote add origin <url>`). `distribute.sh` pushes to and tags `origin/master`.
- `gh` must be authenticated against that repo (`gh auth status`) — the script drafts the release via `gh release create`.
- `.env` must hold at least the Tauri updater signing key (see Step 3). Add the Developer ID and
  notarization credentials too if you want a signed release instead of an unsigned one.

## Pre-flight Checks

Before bumping anything:

- `vp check` and `vp test` pass.
- The `CHANGELOG.md` entry for this release already exists. If it doesn't, write it first as a separate commit — release commits should only touch version fields.

`scripts/distribute.sh` enforces the rest itself: it refuses to run unless you're on `master` with a clean working tree, fast-forward of `origin/master`, and the target tag doesn't already exist locally or on origin.

## Step 1 — Bump the version

The authoritative version lives in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. `scripts/distribute.sh` reads it from there to derive the tag (`v<version>`) and DMG filename. Three other files must be kept in sync so the crate, npm package, and Tauri config all agree:

1. `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` — `version` field
2. `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` — `[package].version`
3. `apps/desktop/package.json` — `version` field
4. `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.lock` — refresh with `cargo update -p desktop --offline` from `apps/desktop/src-tauri/`

Use a patch bump for fixes and small improvements, a minor bump for new user-visible features. Major bumps are reserved for breaking changes or 1.0.

Commit with a message like `Bump version to <version>`. Do not bundle other changes into the bump commit — it should be reviewable in isolation. **Do not push or tag manually** — the script does both.

## Step 2 — Draft user-facing release notes

The detailed bullets in `CHANGELOG.md` are written for engineers — too long and too jargon-heavy for the GitHub release page. The agent drafts a short, user-facing version from the latest dated section of `CHANGELOG.md` and writes it to a markdown file (any path; a temp file is fine).

Guidelines for the drafted notes:

- 3–8 bullets, one short line each. Lead with the user-visible behavior, not the implementation.
- Group as you see fit — typically a short intro paragraph (optional) plus bullets, no headings needed.
- No code spans for internal symbols (`view.setState`, `--surface-card`, etc.) and no spec/PR references.
- Keep wording in the same voice as the existing CHANGELOG (active, terse, sentence case).

The draft is not the final word — you'll review and can edit it directly on GitHub before publishing.

## Step 3 — Run distribute.sh

Run from the repo root, passing the notes file:

```sh
./scripts/distribute.sh --notes-file /tmp/release-notes.md
```

The script will, in order:

1. Validate `.env` and the notes file (must exist and be non-empty). Detects signed vs. unsigned mode from which `APPLE_*` vars are present (see above).
2. Run pre-flight git checks (on master, clean tree, fast-forward of origin, tag doesn't already exist).
3. Push `master` to origin so the commit the release will point at is published before the build starts.
4. Build the desktop crate in release mode (`vp exec tauri build --bundles app,dmg`). When Apple credentials are present, Tauri signs `Kami.app` and the DMG with the Developer ID identity, submits to Apple notarization and waits for the result, then staples the ticket — this is the slowest step and the most likely to fail; if Apple returns anything other than `Accepted`, stop and report the notarization log to the user. When they're absent, the build produces an ad-hoc-signed, non-notarized app instead.
5. Bundle `Kami.app.tar.gz` and produce `Kami.app.tar.gz.sig` using the Tauri updater key — this happens regardless of signed/unsigned mode.
6. Write `latest.json` with the new version, signature, and download URL pointing at `ycparak/kami`.
7. Create a **draft** release on `ycparak/kami` via `gh release create --draft`, uploading the DMG, the updater tarball, and `latest.json`, with the drafted notes attached.
8. Tag this repo with `v<version>` and push the tag to origin.
9. Print the draft URL.

Expect the whole script to take several minutes — most of it is the cargo release build and Apple notarization.

## Step 4 — Review and publish on GitHub

Open the draft URL printed by `distribute.sh`. Confirm:

- Three assets are attached: `Kami_<version>_aarch64.dmg`, `Kami.app.tar.gz`, `latest.json`.
- The notes read well; edit them inline if needed.

Click **Publish release**. Until you do, the in-app updater won't see the new version (the `latest` endpoint skips drafts). If you abandon the draft instead, delete the local and remote tag manually (`git tag -d v<version> && git push origin :refs/tags/v<version>`).

## Step 5 — Verify

- Confirm `https://github.com/ycparak/kami/releases/latest/download/latest.json` resolves to the new version. The in-app updater hits this URL on launch (see `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`).
- Existing installs will pick up the update on next launch.

## When things go wrong

- **Pre-flight check fails.** The script aborted before doing anything irreversible. Read the error, fix the underlying state (commit, pull, bump version, etc.), and re-run.
- **Notarization fails.** Apple's response includes a submission ID. Ask the user how to proceed — do not retry blindly. Common causes: an entitlement mismatch, an unsigned binary inside the bundle, or an expired signing identity.
- **`gh release create` fails because the tag already exists in `kami`.** A previous attempt got far enough to publish. Do not delete the existing release without explicit user permission — it may already be live to users via the updater. Ask first.
- **Build fails after the version bump is committed.** Fix the build, commit the fix, and re-run `distribute.sh`. Do not amend or revert the bump commit unless the user asks for it.
- **The script succeeded but the local tag push failed.** The draft is created; you just need to push the tag. Run `git push origin v<version>` manually. Don't re-run the whole script.
- **You decide not to publish the draft.** Delete the draft on GitHub, then drop the tag: `git tag -d v<version> && git push origin :refs/tags/v<version>`.
- **You realize mid-release that the version was wrong.** Stop. Revert is risky once the GH release exists. Ask the user before taking any destructive action.

## What this doc deliberately does not cover

- Cross-platform releases (Windows, Linux, x86_64 macOS). The script and config are arm64-only today.
- CI-driven releases. There is no GitHub Actions workflow for this — everything runs on the maintainer's machine because of the Apple signing requirement.
- Rolling back a published release. There is no documented rollback procedure; if you need one, escalate to the user.
