title: AGENTS
---

Kami is a Tauri v2 desktop markdown editor: React frontend + Rust backend. It targets writers who use local-first plain-text workflows (Obsidian vaults, docs repos, personal wikis).

## This File

This is an **agent router**: concise context loaded every session. It routes the agent to relevant docs based on task intent. Deep guidelines, system rules, and review rubrics live in linked docs — not here.

## Architecture (Brief)

Stack: Tauri v2 (React + Rust)
Frontend: `apps/desktop/src/` — React, Zustand stores, CodeMirror/Prosemark editor
Backend: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/` — Rust IPC commands, file watcher, workspace state
Toolchain: Vite+ (`vp`) — see [docs/vite-plus.md](./docs/vite-plus.md)

Rust source structure:

- `lib.rs` — app setup, plugin registration, command registration
- `state.rs` — global app state (workspace root, file index, watcher handle)
- `error.rs` — error types serialized over IPC
- `watcher.rs` — file system watcher with debounce and self-write detection
- `commands/` — Tauri IPC handlers: `fs.rs`, `workspace.rs`, `search.rs`, `images.rs`

## Docs Index

All docs except CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, TODOS.md, and CHANGELOG.md live in `./docs/`. Feature specs live in `./SPECs/`.

**Workflow**

- [docs/workflows/agent-loop.md](./docs/workflows/agent-loop.md) — repeatable autonomous task execution loop
- [docs/workflows/agent-review.md](./docs/workflows/agent-review.md) — review personas, findings format, quality checklist, escalation rules
- [docs/workflows/worktrees.md](./docs/workflows/worktrees.md) — creating and managing parallel worktrees

**Guidelines**

- [docs/consolidation.md](./docs/consolidation.md) — if adding the next case touches more than one file, the structure is wrong: single source of truth, side-effect ownership, registry over per-case branches, one write path
- [docs/react-guidelines.md](./docs/react-guidelines.md) — imports, state, side effects, component structure, persistence
- [docs/zustand.md](./docs/zustand.md) — side effect timing, selectors, bail-out patterns
- [docs/editor.md](./docs/editor.md) — CodeMirror layout-model APIs, scroll-handler ownership, block-widget patterns (decoration shape, range-select to enter edit mode, posAtDOM boundary handling, button focus race, scrollSnapshot for heightmap shifts)
- [docs/pane-layout.md](./docs/pane-layout.md) — the columns/stacked pane system: renderer owns positioning, focused pane vs editor focus, suppress vs freeze unfurling, the single open-placement resolver, pane width as pure CSS, e2e gotchas
- [docs/vite-plus.md](./docs/vite-plus.md) — `vp` CLI usage and common pitfalls
- [docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md](./docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md) — canonical shortcut map

**Infra**

- [docs/releasing.md](./docs/releasing.md) — how to cut a signed, notarized macOS release
- [docs/website-deploy.md](./docs/website-deploy.md) — how to deploy the marketing website to Cloudflare Workers

**Cross-cutting**

- [TODOS.md](./TODOS.md) — task backlog and work-in-progress tracking
- [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) — user-visible changes log
- [SPECs/](./SPECs/) — human-written feature and bug specs

## Hard Rules

- Check [`TODOS.md`](./TODOS.md) before starting work to see current tasks.
- Move tasks between sections (Up Next → In Progress → Done) as you work.
- For non-trivial work, create a spec in [`SPECs/`](./SPECs/) and link it from the task.
- Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) when completing work.
- Load only docs relevant to the current task and scope.
- If a behavior or rule changes in practice, update the owning doc in the same task.
- In autonomous/loop mode, complete exactly one task at a time and commit immediately. Do not batch unless the user explicitly asks.
- When coding or reviewing, follow the Engineering Guardrails below and the guidelines in linked docs.

## Engineering Guardrails

- Prefer the smallest change that is correct, robust, and easy to reason about.
- Avoid fragile logic, hidden coupling, edge-case traps, and assumptions about incidental execution order.
- Keep async flows and shared state race-safe. Use explicit sequencing, cancellation, idempotency, or clear ownership where needed.
- Do not introduce unnecessary performance regressions. Avoid extra renders, allocations, subscriptions, scans, blocking work, or I/O unless clearly justified.
- Fail explicitly. Surface invalid states and unexpected errors clearly instead of silently swallowing them or masking them with fallback behavior.
- Preserve testability. Keep side effects at the boundaries, make dependencies explicit, and structure logic so it can be exercised in isolation when practical.
- Maintain clear boundaries, but prefer minimal designs. Split functions, hooks, or modules when responsibilities meaningfully diverge, not as a reflex.
- If a tradeoff is unavoidable, call it out explicitly and choose the option with the lowest long-term correctness and maintenance risk.
- When a fix doesn't work after one iteration, add a debug log before changing the approach again. Don't iterate on guesses — let the runtime tell you which term in the math is wrong.

## Validation

Frontend:

- `vp check` — format, lint, and TypeScript type checks
- `vp test` — JavaScript/TypeScript tests

Rust (from `apps/desktop/src-tauri/`):

- `cargo test`
- `cargo clippy`
- `cargo fmt --check`

## Session Wrap

Wrap per [agent-loop.md](./docs/workflows/agent-loop.md). One commit per completed task with a clear message. See the existing commit history for style.

<!--VITE PLUS START-->

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.
